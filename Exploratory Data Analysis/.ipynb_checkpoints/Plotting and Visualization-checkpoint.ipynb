    "It is a desktop plotting package made by John Hunter in 2002 to enable MATLAB-like plotting interface in Python. Thanks to the collaboration betweeen the Matplotlib and IPython communities right now we have an easy way to make interactive plotting from he IPython shell (Jupyter notebooks). We will see that we can make a lot of type of plots and export them in different graphic formats (like PDF, SVG, PNG, GIF). "
