    "+ Tools for reading/writing array data to disk and working with memory-mapped files.\n",

    "NumPy is so important for numerical computations in Python is because it is designed for efficiency on large arrays of data. There are a number of reasons for this:\n",
    "+ NumPy internally stores data in a contiguous block of memory, independent of other built-in Python objects. NumPy's library of algorithms written in the C language can operate on this memory without any checking or other overhead. \n",
    "+ NumPy operations perform complex computations on entire arrays without the need for Python for loops.\n"
