    "TensorFlow is an open source machine learning library for research and production, it is recognized due its implementations in _deep learning_. This project was proposed for high numerical computation. It has a flexible architecture for the deployment across a variety of platforms(i.e. CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to cluster of servers to mobile \n",

    "TensorFlow integrates the concept of computing operations that interact with one another through the application of dataflow graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph concept is a simple abstraction of nodes interconnected by edges, this concept is applicated in different contexts, for example network communications, neuronal networks and other kind of situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a _dataflow graph_, the edges allow data to \"flow\" from one node to another in a directed manner. On the other hand, each of the graph's nodes represents an operation, possibly applied to some input, and can generate an output that is transmitted on to other nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operations in the graph include all kinds of functions, from simple arithmetic ones such as multiplication to more complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each graph has its own set of node dependencies and these relationships are classified as _direct_ and _indirect_. Being able to locate dependencies between units of our model allows us to both distribute computations across available resources and avoid performing redundant processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"A Graph contains a set of tf.Operation objects, which represent units of computation; and tf.Tensor objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations\"[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "A Tensor is a N-dimensional vector, we can call (1000x3x3) as the shape or dimension of the resulting Tensor. Tensors can either be a constant or a variable\n",
