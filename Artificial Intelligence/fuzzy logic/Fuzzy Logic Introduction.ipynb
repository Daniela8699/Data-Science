This has several _terms_ that are used to describe it, for example some categorical characteristics like \"poor\", \"mediocre\", and \"good\". Each term has a membership function that defines who crisp value is on a scale of 0 to 1.\n",

    "Moveover, we have a _fuzzy control system_ which links fuzzy variables using a set of _rules_. These rules are sumply mapping that describes how one or more fuzzy variables relates to another (they are noted in terms of an IF-THEN). Each rule has its _antecedent_ and its _consequent_.\n"
